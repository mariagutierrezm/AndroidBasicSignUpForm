# AndroidBasicSignUpForm

A simple basic form created in Android Studio, both hard coding and using the available design tools. 
Is coded in Java and will give a junior developer a good understanding to start creating apps in Android.

I hope you enjoy and like it. 
Took the idea from this youtube tutorial https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII. 
Is a 2 part course/tutorial, worth watching if you have a basic solid understanding of Java and are keen to learn android development.
